## FAQ

### 2. What is a `Puppet` in Wechaty

The term [Puppet](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty/wiki/Puppet) in Wechaty is an Abstract Class for implementing protocol plugins. The plugins are the component that helps Wechaty to control the Wechat(that's the reason we call it puppet).

The plugins are named `PuppetXXX`, like [PuppetPuppeteer](https://github.com/Chatie/wechaty-puppet-puppeteer) is using the [google puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to control the [WeChat Web API](https://wx.qq.com) via a chrome browser, [PuppetPadchat](https://github.com/lijiarui/wechaty-puppet-padchat) is using the WebSocket protocol to connect with a Protocol Server for controlling the iPad Wechat program.
